## Description
Modified starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. It will also delete note data from a JSON file. It connects the starter Front-End code to the added Back-End code to create a functional application deployed to Heroku.
